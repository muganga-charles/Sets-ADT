# Sets-ADT

In python,Sets are well known for storing of values that are unduplicates (not the same/not repeating).<br />
The program has diffrent functions that adds,checks whether the sets are equal,adds items to the set, and shows the length of the set.<br />
It can be impleamented such that it can be an entry of two sets which we later compare.
