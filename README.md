# Sets-ADT

In python, Sets are well known for storing of values that are not duplicates (not the same/not repeating).<br />
The program has diffrent functions that checks whether the sets are equal, adds items to the set, and shows the length of the set.<br />
It can be impleamented such that it can be an entry of two sets which we later compare..<br />
